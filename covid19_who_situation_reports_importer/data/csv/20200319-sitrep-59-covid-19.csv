Objectives Study Protocol	Unnamed: 1
The First Few COVID-19 cases and contacts transmission investigation protocol (FFX)	To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the: • • • • clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age and sex, for various end-points) serial interval of COVID-19 infection symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission
Households transmission of COVID-19 investigation protocol	• To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections To characterize serologic response following confirmed COVID-19 infection • •
Assessment of COVID-19 risk factors among Health workers protocol	• To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker contacts at an individual level To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors for infection among health care workers To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among health care workers • •
Surface sampling of COVID-19 for health care professionals	• To assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19 virus To identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission of COVID-19 infection •
Population based serologic survey	• To estimate age-specific seroprevalence
